                       My name is Khodor Safa and I am originally from Beirut, Lebanon. I obtained my bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with distinction from the American University of Beirut in 2018. During my undergraduate studies I developed a passion for programming, engineering systems design and acquired an affinity for communication systems, their fundamentals and applications. Soon after graduating, I was offered the opportunity to work as an IT analyst at Philip Morris International, Beirut as part of the Egypt and Levant cluster team. This was an exemplary experience for me to understand the fast-paced dynamics of a corporate environment, where I enriched both my interpersonal and technical skills tackling hands-on business projects and coordinating with colleagues across departments both on a local and regional level. In 2021, I obtained my Master's degree in Advanced Wireless Communication Systems at CentraleSupélec, France. During this period I honed my technical skills in digital communications, MIMO wireless communication, signal processing and optimization. I also enriched my knowledge about 5G and 6G technologies and had several opportunities to tackle related problems and challenges during my research project and internship at Nokia Bell Labs. I recently obtained my PhD in network, information and communication sciences at CentraleSupélec, France tackling challenges of next generational communication systems, particularly nonlinearities with a focus on low resolution quantization. This was a unique and fruitful experience that deepened my technical knowledge in MIMO wireless systems, RF nonlinearities, statistical signal processing, convex and non-convex optimization, and information theory. 
					</p>
					 <p>					
					   Currently, I am seeking opportunities as a research engineer in the telecommunications field or similar roles. I consider myself a fast learner, highly autonomous, and always at the ready to explore new challenges and solve interesting problems.

I was responsible for the hardware and signal processing design and implementation of the project. The radar was built using simple directive Yagi antennas, coaxial cables, NI USRP 2920 as SDR and a basic workstation for the analysis and computations using GNU Radio and Python.

							For my Master's level adaptive control course during my undergraduate studies, we were asked to apply the theoretical knowledge acquired to design an adaptive controller for an inverted pendulum which is a highly nonlinear system. The pendulum model was linearized before designing adaptive controller schemes on Simulink and Matlab including self-tuning regulators and model reference adaptive controllers.
